# Issue Tracker

a re-code of issue tracker app from Pro MERN Stack by Vasan Subramanian 

Source code by the original author can be found at: https://github.com/vasansr/pro-mern-stack

## Why re-code?

I made the changes to conform with latest versions of packages used. the version used in the sample is old and deprecated.

see the [changes](deviations_from_sample.md) I made from the original code.

## setup:

1. Install NodeJS. I used ^16 and make sure it is on path
2. Install MongoDB (I used 4.4)
3. run mongod (or enable if installed as service)
2. clone this repository (check the Clone button on repository home page)
3. cd to the cloned repository
`cd issue-tracker`
4. run `npm ci`
5.
5. run `npm run compile`
6. run `npm run start`
7. go to localhost:3000 on your preferred browser.
